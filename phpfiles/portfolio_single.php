				<h2>Our Tasks</h2>
				<p>Belligerent and numerous. Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money. It's toe-tappingly tragic! I love you, buddy!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people.</li>
					<li>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns."</li>
					<li>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.</li>
					<li>Dad didn't leave&hellip; When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face!</li>

				<h2>How we did it</h2>
				<p>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Oh, I don't have time for this.  I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. I never loved you. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!</p>
				<p>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns." Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. Dad didn't leave&hellip; When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face!</p>
