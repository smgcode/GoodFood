				<p>What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies. Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1&hellip;2. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</p>
				<p>I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes!</p>
