					<p>Homer no function beer well without. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!</p>
					<p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip; Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?</p>
					<ul>
					<li>You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.</li>
					<li>That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.</li>
					<li>Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot.</li>
					<li>Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.</li>
					<li>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is&hellip; Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing? Ahoy hoy? You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story." I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention!</p>
					<p>Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.</p>
					<ol>
					<li>Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1&hellip;2.</li>
					<li>Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.</li>
					<li>Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get. You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.</p>

							I'm a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.
